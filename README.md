## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MM1026-DS/Deep-learning-logistic-Regression-.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Deep-learning-logistic-Regression-
   ```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'env\Scripts\activate'
   ```

4. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can explore the implementation and run the logistic regression model:

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Deep_learning_logistic_regression.ipynb
   ```

2. **Follow the instructions within the notebook** to understand and execute the code cells.
